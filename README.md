# Dumb Docker

This repo contains a simple Next.js frontend with a backend container. The frontend proxies API
requests to the backend using an internal environment variable.

## Environment Variables

- `BACKEND_URL` â€“ address of the backend API. Defaults to `http://backend:8000` when not set.
  `docker-compose.yml` sets this to the backend service so the frontend can access the API in
  development.

If you are running in GitHub Codespaces, ensure this variable is set in your devcontainer or compose
configuration so the API proxy works correctly.

## Development

Run the application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This starts the frontend on port `3000` and the backend on port `8000`.
